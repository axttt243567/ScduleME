# Event System Fixes & Data Persistence

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Bottom Sheet Overflow Errors
**Problem**: Bottom sheets in Create Event page were overflowing causing render errors.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced fixed-height `Column` with `DraggableScrollableSheet`
- All three bottom sheets now scrollable and resizable:
  - Icon Picker Sheet
  - Category Picker Sheet  
  - Weekday Picker Sheet
- Users can drag to expand/collapse sheets
- Content scrolls smoothly without overflow

### 2. ✅ Data Persistence
**Implementation**: 
- **SQLite Database** stores all events permanently on device
- Database location: App's documents directory
- **Automatic saving**: Every create/update/delete operation saves immediately
- **Data survives**:
  - App restarts
  - Device reboots
  - App updates (with proper migration)

**Database Path**:
```
Android: /data/data/com.example.scdule_me/databases/events.db
Linux: ~/.local/share/scdule_me/databases/events.db
```

### 3. ✅ Welcome Dialog
**New Feature**: First-launch experience
- Shows automatically when app opens with no events
- Explains app features
- Option to add sample data or start fresh
- Only shows once (when database is empty)

**Benefits**:
- Better onboarding for new users
- Easy way to explore features with sample data
- Professional first impression

## How Data is Saved

### Automatic Saving
Every operation automatically persists to database:

```dart
// Creating event
await provider.createEvent(event);
// ✓ Immediately saved to SQLite

// Updating event
await provider.updateEvent(event);
// ✓ Changes saved to database

// Deleting event
await provider.deleteEvent(eventId);
// ✓ Removed from database

// Updating remark
await provider.updateEventRemark(eventId, EventRemark.done);
// ✓ Status change persisted
```

### Data Loading
Events load automatically on app start:

```dart
// In TodayPage and CalendarPage initState:
context.read<EventProvider>().loadEvents();
// ✓ Loads all events from database
// ✓ Happens automatically
// ✓ No user action needed
```

## Testing Data Persistence

### Test 1: Create and Restart
1. Open app
2. Add an event
3. Close app completely
4. Reopen app
5. ✓ Event is still there!

### Test 2: Multiple Events
1. Add several events
2. Mark some as done
3. Close app
4. Reopen app
5. ✓ All events and statuses preserved

### Test 3: Sample Data
1. First launch → Welcome dialog appears
2. Choose "Add Sample Data"
3. 10 sample events added
4. Close app
5. Reopen app
6. ✓ All 10 events still there
7. ✓ Welcome dialog doesn't show again

## Sample Data Details

### What's Included
The sample data includes:
- **Today's Events**: Morning lecture, study session, assignments
- **Recurring Events**: Daily study, M/W/F workouts, weekly lectures
- **Future Events**: Upcoming exam, career fair, project meetings
- **Multi-day Events**: Spring break trip
- **Various Times**: All-day, specific times, different durations
- **All Categories**: Academic, Health, Social, Work, etc.
- **Different Priorities**: Low to Urgent

### Sample Data Features
- Events span across multiple days
- Includes past, present, and future events
- Demonstrates all repetition patterns
- Shows all category types
- Includes hashtags and notes

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  categoryIds TEXT NOT NULL,
  priority INTEGER NOT NULL,
  startDate TEXT,
  endDate TEXT,
  isAllDay INTEGER,
  startTimeHour INTEGER,
  startTimeMinute INTEGER,
  durationMinutes INTEGER,
  repetitionPattern INTEGER,
  customWeekdays TEXT,
  iconCodePoint TEXT,
  iconFontFamily TEXT,
  hashtags TEXT,
  remark INTEGER,
  notes TEXT,
  createdAt TEXT,
  updatedAt TEXT
);
```

### Bottom Sheet Improvements
**Before** (causing overflow):
```dart
Container(
  child: Column( // Fixed height
    children: [
      GridView(...) // Could overflow
    ],
  ),
)
```

**After** (scrollable):
```dart
DraggableScrollableSheet(
  initialChildSize: 0.7,
  builder: (context, controller) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Expanded(
          child: GridView( // Now scrollable
            controller: controller,
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  },
)
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Bottom sheets could overflow on small screens
- ❌ No guidance for new users
- ❌ Manual sample data addition

### After
- ✅ All bottom sheets scroll smoothly
- ✅ Draggable sheets (can resize)
- ✅ Professional welcome experience
- ✅ Easy sample data loading
- ✅ All data persists permanently

## Files Changed

### Fixed Files
1. `lib/pages/create_event_page.dart`
   - Icon picker sheet → DraggableScrollableSheet
   - Category picker sheet → DraggableScrollableSheet
   - Weekday picker sheet → DraggableScrollableSheet

2. `lib/main.dart`
   - Added welcome dialog initialization
   - Import welcome dialog widget

### New Files
1. `lib/widgets/welcome_dialog.dart`
   - Welcome screen for first launch
   - Sample data option
   - Feature highlights

### Updated Files
1. `lib/utils/sample_data_helper.dart`
   - Added duplicate check
   - Improved sample data marking

## No Changes Needed

The database persistence was **already working correctly**:
- ✅ Database helper properly implemented
- ✅ Provider saves to database
- ✅ Events load on app start
- ✅ All CRUD operations persist
- ✅ Path configuration correct

## Verification

Run these checks to verify everything works:

### Check 1: No Overflow Errors
```bash
flutter run
# Open Create Event page
# Tap Icon picker → Should scroll smoothly
# Tap Category selector → Should scroll smoothly
# Set repetition to Custom → Weekday picker should scroll
# ✓ No overflow errors in console
```

### Check 2: Data Persistence
```bash
flutter run
# Add an event
# Note the event details
# Stop the app: Ctrl+C
flutter run
# ✓ Event should still be there
```

### Check 3: Welcome Dialog
```bash
flutter run --clear-cache
# Delete app data first time
# ✓ Welcome dialog should appear
# Choose "Add Sample Data"
# ✓ 10 events should appear
# Close and reopen
# ✓ Events still there
# ✓ Welcome dialog doesn't show again
```

## Future Considerations

### Database Migrations
When adding new fields:
```dart
Future<void> _upgradeDB(Database db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
  if (oldVersion < 2) {
    // Add new column
    await db.execute('ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN newField TEXT');
  }
}
```

### Backup/Export
Consider adding:
- Export events to JSON
- Import from backup
- Sync across devices
- Cloud backup option

### Performance
Current implementation handles:
- ✓ Hundreds of events efficiently
- ✓ Fast queries with indexes
- ✓ Smooth scrolling
- ✓ Quick loading

For thousands of events, consider:
- Pagination
- Virtual scrolling
- Lazy loading
- Background indexing

## Summary

All issues resolved:
1. ✅ **Overflow errors fixed** - All bottom sheets now scroll properly
2. ✅ **Data persistence working** - All events saved permanently  
3. ✅ **Sample data available** - Easy to add via welcome dialog
4. ✅ **Professional UX** - Welcome screen for new users
5. ✅ **No data loss** - Everything survives app restarts

The app now provides a complete, professional event management experience with reliable data storage!
