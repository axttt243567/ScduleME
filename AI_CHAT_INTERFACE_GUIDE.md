# AI Chat Interface for Event Creation - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the new AI-powered chat interface for creating calendar events with intelligent suggestions, interactive chips, and visual widgets.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Models** (`lib/models/ai_chat_models.dart`)
- `ChatMessageType`: Enum defining message types (text, chips, dateTimePicker, eventTypeCards, etc.)
- `ChipSelectionMode`: Enum for chip behavior (single, multiple, toggle, singleWithConfirm)
- `ChipOption`: Individual chip with id, label, icon, and value
- `ChipGroup`: Collection of chips with selection mode and submit behavior
- `EventTypeCard`: Visual card for event category selection
- `EventCreationStep`: Progress tracking for event creation steps
- `AiChatMessage`: Main message model supporting all widget types
- `AiResponse`: Structured AI response with JSON parsing

#### 2. **AI Service** (`lib/utils/ai_event_service.dart`)
Enhanced Gemini API service with:
- Structured JSON response generation
- Context-aware prompts with current date/time
- Pre-defined chip templates (quick actions, dates, priorities, repetitions)
- Event type card generation
- Conversation flow management

Key methods:
- `generateEventCreationResponse()`: Main AI response generator
- `getQuickActionChips()`: Retry, Bad Response, Shorter options
- `getDateSuggestionChips()`: Today, Tomorrow, Next Week, Custom
- `getRepetitionChips()`: None, Daily, Weekly, Custom
- `getPriorityChips()`: Low, Medium, High, Urgent

#### 3. **Interactive Widgets**

##### Interactive Chips (`lib/widgets/interactive_chip_widget.dart`)
- Supports all selection modes (single auto-submit, multiple with button, toggle)
- Smooth animations on selection
- Long-press for additional options
- Horizontal scrollable layout
- Quick action chips (Retry, Bad Response, Shorter)
- Loading animations

##### Inline Date/Time Pickers (`lib/widgets/inline_date_time_picker.dart`)
- **InlineDatePicker**: Compact calendar in chat bubble
  - Month navigation
  - Quick selection buttons (Today, Tomorrow, Next Week)
  - Current day highlighting
  - Selected date indication
  
- **InlineTimePicker**: Compact time selector
  - Hour/minute steppers
  - 5-minute intervals for minutes
  - Quick time buttons (Now, 9 AM, 2 PM, 6 PM)

##### Event Type Cards (`lib/widgets/event_type_cards_widget.dart`)
- Visual category selection with icons and colors
- AI suggestion badges
- Single/multiple selection support
- Horizontal scrollable layout
- Default categories from existing system
- Loading animations

##### Chat Bubbles (`lib/widgets/ai_chat_bubble.dart`)
- Unified bubble supporting all message types

- Timestamps
- Quick actions for AI messages
- Loading and error states
- Typing indicator animation

##### Progress Tracker (`lib/widgets/event_creation_progress_tracker.dart`)
- Step-by-step progress visualization
- Compact and full view modes
- Jump to any step (if completed)
- Edit completed steps
- Progress bar with completion percentage
- Default steps: Purpose, Type, Date & Time, Repetition, Priority, Details

##### Event Preview (`lib/widgets/event_preview_screen.dart`)
- Full-screen event details before confirmation
- Visual card layout with icons
- Edit and confirm actions
- AI creation badge
- Compact preview card for in-chat display

#### 4. **Main Page** (`lib/pages/ai_event_creator_page_new.dart`)
Comprehensive AI chat interface featuring:
- Message history with scroll management
- Real-time typing indicator
- Progress tracking with compact view
- Event data collection
- Context management for conversation
- Multiple handler methods for different interactions
- Event preview and creation workflow

## Features Implementation

### 1. **Smart Chip System**
The AI can send chip options in different selection modes:

```dart
// Single selection (auto-submit)
{
  "selectionMode": "single",
  "options": [
    {"id": "yes", "label": "Yes", "value": true},
    {"id": "no", "label": "No", "value": false}
  ]
}

// Multiple selection (with submit button)
{
  "selectionMode": "multiple",
  "options": [
    {"id": "work", "label": "Work", "value": "work"},
    {"id": "urgent", "label": "Urgent", "value": "urgent"}
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Inline Widgets**
Date and time pickers are embedded directly in chat bubbles:
- Compact design fits in conversation flow
- Quick selection buttons for common choices
- Visual feedback for selected values

### 3. **Event Type Cards**
Visual category selection with:
- Icons and colors from existing categories
- AI-suggested categories with badges
- Scrollable horizontal layout
- Single/multiple selection support

### 4. **Progress Tracking**
- 6 default steps for event creation
- Real-time updates as data is collected
- Ability to jump back and edit any step
- Visual progress bar
- Compact view in chat header

### 5. **Conversation Flow**
Typical interaction flow:
1. AI asks about event purpose (open-ended)
2. AI suggests event types via visual cards
3. AI asks yes/no questions using chips
4. AI requests date/time using inline pickers
5. AI asks about repetition using chips
6. AI asks about priority using chips
7. AI shows event preview
8. User confirms and event is created

## AI Prompt Engineering

The AI system prompt includes:
- Current date/time context
- Available categories and priorities
- JSON response format specifications
- Selection mode guidelines
- Conversation flow best practices
- Quick action options

Example AI response formats are documented in the system prompt to ensure consistent structured responses.

## Usage

### Navigation
To use the new AI Event Creator, navigate from your main app:

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const AiEventCreatorPageNew(),
  ),
);
```

### Integration with Existing System
The page integrates with:
- `EventProvider`: For event creation
- `ApiKeyProvider`: For Gemini API key management
- Existing `Event`, `Category`, and `Priority` models
- Database through EventProvider

### Required Setup
1. Ensure user has a valid Gemini API key configured
2. API key should be active in ApiKeyProvider
3. No additional dependencies needed (all included in pubspec.yaml)

## Customization

### Adding New Chip Templates
Add methods to `AiEventService`:
```dart
static List<ChipOption> getCustomChips() {
  return [
    ChipOption(id: '...', label: '...', value: '...'),
  ];
}
```

### Modifying Conversation Flow
Update the system prompt in `AiEventService._buildSystemPrompt()` to change:
- Question order
- Response formats
- Available options
- Conversation style

### Custom Event Type Cards
Use `EventTypeCardHelper.fromCategories()` to create cards from your categories:
```dart
final cards = EventTypeCardHelper.fromCategories(
  myCategories,
  aiSuggestedIds: ['academic', 'exam'],
);
```

### Extending Progress Steps
Modify `EventCreationSteps.getDefaultSteps()` to add/remove steps:
```dart
EventCreationStep(
  id: 'custom_step',
  title: 'Custom Field',
  stepNumber: 7,
)
```

## Animation System

All widgets include smooth animations:
- Chip selection: Scale and shadow animation (200ms)
- Message appearance: Fade in animation (300ms)
- Loading states: Continuous pulse animation (1500ms)
- Progress updates: Linear progress animation
- Button interactions: Material ripple effects

## Error Handling

The system handles:
- API key missing/invalid
- Network failures
- JSON parsing errors
- Invalid AI responses (fallback to text)
- User input validation

Errors are displayed as special chat messages with retry options.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep conversations natural**: AI should feel conversational, not robotic
2. **Use context**: Always pass current date and existing data
3. **Provide quick options**: Chips should cover 80% of common choices
4. **Allow customization**: Always provide "Custom" or "Other" options
5. **Confirm before saving**: Show full preview before creating event
6. **Enable editing**: Users should be able to go back and modify any field
7. **Visual feedback**: Provide immediate feedback for all interactions
8. **Progress visibility**: Always show users where they are in the process
