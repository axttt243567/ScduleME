# Clear All Data - Quick Reference

## What It Does
Completely wipes all app data and resets the app to a fresh state, as if it was just installed.

## User Flow
1. Profile ‚Üí Account Settings ‚Üí Data Management ‚Üí Clear All Data
2. Confirmation dialog with warning appears
3. User confirms ‚Üí Loading screen shows
4. Data is cleared ‚Üí Returns to home
5. Success message displays
6. Welcome dialog will show on next interaction

## What Gets Deleted
‚úÖ All events  
‚úÖ All event notes  
‚úÖ All event data  
‚úÖ Database file  
‚úÖ In-memory cache  

## What Stays
‚ùå App settings (none implemented yet)  
‚ùå Theme preferences (uses default)  
‚ùå App installation  

## Code Changes

### 1. DatabaseHelper (`lib/database/database_helper.dart`)
```dart
Future<void> clearAllData() async {
  // Closes DB, deletes file, resets instance
}
```

### 2. EventProvider (`lib/providers/event_provider.dart`)
```dart
Future<void> clearAllData() async {
  // Clears DB + in-memory events
}
```

### 3. AccountSettingsPage (`lib/pages/account_settings_page.dart`)
```dart
void _showClearDataDialog() { /* Shows confirmation */ }
Future<void> _confirmClearData() async { /* Executes clearing */ }
```

## Safety Features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Two-step confirmation required
- üö´ Cannot dismiss loading dialog
- üî¥ Red warning colors throughout
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user feedback
- üè† Auto-navigation to home after completion

## Testing
```bash
# Run the app
flutter run

# Navigate to: Profile > Account Settings > Clear All Data
# Test: Confirm and verify all events are deleted
# Test: Welcome dialog shows after clearing
# Test: Can create new events after clearing
```

## Key Files Modified
1. `lib/database/database_helper.dart` - Added `clearAllData()` method
2. `lib/providers/event_provider.dart` - Added `clearAllData()` method  
3. `lib/pages/account_settings_page.dart` - Updated `_showClearDataDialog()` and added `_confirmClearData()`
4. Added imports: `provider` and `event_provider` to account_settings_page

## After Clearing
- App shows empty state
- Welcome dialog appears (offers sample data)
- Can start adding events immediately
- Database recreated automatically on first event

## Error Handling
If clearing fails:
- Error message shown to user
- App remains functional
- Can retry clearing
- Fallback: Deletes all records if file deletion fails
